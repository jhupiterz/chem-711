# Sample visualizer 

This repo contains all the data and code of the interactive dashboard created to showcase the results of my PhD research.

## For CHEM 711

The data is stored in `data` folder and csv file is `plfa_dataset.csv` 

For the code, the notebook with PCA and hierarchical clustering is in `notebook` folder called `chem_711.ipynb`.

# Dashboard

The interactive **sample visualizer** is currently working offline on your own machine if you clone this repo.

Then in your terminal navigate to your cloned repo and type in the following commands:

`$ python app.py` 

This will laucnh the app on port `http://127.0.0.1:8050/`.

The app will be later deployed on Heroku.
